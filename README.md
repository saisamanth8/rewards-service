Rewards Service
===============================

A retailer offers a rewards program to its customers, awarding points based on each recorded purchase.

A customer receives 2 points for every dollar spent over $100 in each transaction, plus 1 point for every dollar spent between $50 and $100 in each transaction.
(e.g., a $120 purchase = 2x$20 + 1x$50 = 90 points).

Given a record of every transaction during a three-month period, calculate the reward points earned for each customer per month and total.
Here are the tasks to achieve
1. Implement the given requirement using Spring boot
2. Implement with API First in design
3. Implement controller, service and repository layers separately with proper exception handling
   4 Create a RESTful endpoint
   5 Make up a data set to best demonstrate your solution
   6 Check solution into GitHub
